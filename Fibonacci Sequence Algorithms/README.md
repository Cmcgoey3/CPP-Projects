# Fibonacci Sequence Project

## Author

## Description
The two C++ files provide two different ways to product a fibonacci sequence of n elements. The recursive definition has much simpler code, but runs slower with a O(2^n) run time. The dynamic programming code runs faster with a time complexity of O(n).

## To run
Refer to the Makefile with commands on building the object files for each C++ file.
